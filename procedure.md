Follow this procedure when doing new implementations and when prompted to do so.

- Run any commands with the conda env 'ood' active. This is where all of our 
  dependencies are installed.
Be sure to read any relevant code and documentation.
- Think about whether the instructions are clear and whether they make sense.
- If you need more context to understand whether they make sense, it is also ok to ask
  for clarification.
- If anything is still unclear, ask for clarification.
- If the instructions don't make sense in your estimation, ask for clarification.
- Run the linter and formatter in @ci/format_and_check.sh after making changes.
